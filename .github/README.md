### 🚀 Vision

Ruthenium aims to bring **the power and performance of low-level languages** with the **ease and readability of high-level scripting**, supporting both interpreted and compiled workflows. With support for plugins, raw memory operations, and fine control over your environment, Ruthenium is perfect for creators who want to push the limits of what a language can do.
